# PCA-vs-FA
Principal Component Analysis vs Factor Analysis:
The goal of this Jupyter notebook is to offer an environment to experiment with Principal Component Analysis and Factor Analysis on synthetic data. A synthetic dataset makes the most sense for this project because it gives the user total control. By providing a few sliders to shape the dataset, the user can gain a more intuitive understanding of how various variables influence dimensionality-reduction techniques, namely, Principal Component Analysis and Factor Analysis.
